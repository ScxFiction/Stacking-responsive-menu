Proof of concept 'stacking' responsive menu
===========================================

Concept for alternative navigation/design pattern for repsonsive sites, trying to replicate the 'browser tab' menu in the current Chrome for iOS app - providing a more interesting and innovative approach to displaying content at smaller screen sizes, see blog post [here](http://neilcarpenter.com/2012/09/proof-of-concept-stacking-responsive-menu).

**See the demo [here](http://neilcarpenter.com/demos/stack-menu)**

Example uses jQuery but not a necessity, the actual work is mostly handled by CSS transitions and 2D transforms. In theory should be supported by most mobile browsers as isn't dependent on anything too fancy, but as is just a proof of concept, it hasn't been thoroughly tested.
