                <h1>Proof of concept 'stacking' responsive menu</h1>
                <p>I read a lengthy <a href="https://plus.google.com/113127438179392830442/posts/fR3iiuN4kEF" target="_blank">thread/discussion on Google+</a> the other day about the state of the web applications, specifically in relation to native apps on mobile devices. I had always taken it as a given that the open web would prevail over proprietary and device-specific technologies, and that it was just a matter of time before the web catches up, but this article kind of worried me, with plenty of well-respected members of the web community voicing concern of the lack of urgency in implementing features to bring the web on a par with native applications, and that in fact it may never catch up.</p>
                <p>That made me sad. So, basically, I wanted to see how easy it would be to <em>recreate</em> a native app interaction - specifically the 'browser tab' menu from Chrome for iOS. I like the Chrome app, it has a slick interface with nice transitions and makes the most of a gesture-based OS. Anyway, it was much easier to recreate the stacking windows effect than I thought it would be, proof that we need to start seeing this kind of thing in web-based apps/sites, because INTERNET.</p>
                <p>Resize your window, or even better load this page in a responsive tester like <a href="http://responsive.is/neilcarpenter.com/demos/stack-menu" title="responsive.is" target="_blank">this one</a>, or <em>even</em> better try it on a real phone, and see the 'stacking effect' of page sections. Only had a chance to test on iPhone 4S & 3GS but seems to be holding up okay.</p>

                <h1>Rebel Mission to Ord Mantell</h1>
                <p>Ye-ha! <em>I'm trying not to, kid</em>. I'm trying not to, kid. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. <a href="#">Several transmissions</a> were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</p>
                <h2>The Empire Strikes Back</h2>
                <p>In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. <strong>I've seen a lot of strange stuff</strong>, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?</p>

                <p>All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. He is here. You don't believe in the Force, do you? As you wish. You don't believe in the Force, do you?</p>
                <h4>The Rebel Force</h4>
                <p>You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. <em>I don't know what you're talking about</em>. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--</p>

                <p>Partially, but it also obeys your commands. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?

                <p>All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like&hellip;suicide. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.

                <h4>Revenge of the Sith</h4>
                <p>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!
